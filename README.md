# Run test on Autify for Web

Run a test scenario or test plan on Autify for Web.

See our official documentation to get started: https://help.autify.com/docs/github-actions-integration

## Usage

### Run a test scenario or test plan

```yaml
- uses: autifyhq/actions-web-test-run@v2
  with:
    access-token: ${{ secrets.AUTIFY_WEB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    autify-test-url: https://app.autify.com/projects/<ID>/(scenarios|test_plans)/<ID>
```

This will succeed immediately once the test is started but won't wait the finish of the test.

### Run and wait a test scenario or test plan

```yaml
- uses: autifyhq/actions-web-test-run@v2
  with:
    access-token: ${{ secrets.AUTIFY_WEB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    autify-test-url: https://app.autify.com/projects/<ID>/(scenarios|test_plans)/<ID>
    wait: true
    timeout: 300
```

This will keep running the action until the test finishes or times out.

**Note: This will consume your GitHub Actions hosted runner's minutes. Be careful when extending the timeout value.**
